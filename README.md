# Lab 7: Interactive Activation Networks

In this lab you'll get some practice building a network that involves interactive activation. It's a simpler network than the original IAC model, focusing on only two levels (features and digits). The goal here is to get some hands-on experience with writing code for a network model from (mostly) scratch.
